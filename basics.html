    <!--Use Paragraph tag as shown below for normal size characters -->

    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    <!--Know that heading and paragraph tags are their own block-->

    <!--Note that in HTML indentation doesn't really matter or dictates which code goes into what block like other
    in other programming languages in HTML it is the tags that determines blocks of code.-->

    <!--Example below is the old way of making characters bold in Html by calling the b tag on the target character -->
    <p><b>This is the old way of making a letter bold using the b tag</b></p>
    
    <!--Example below is the old way of making characters Italics in Html by calling the i tag on the target character -->
    <p><i>This is the old way of making a letter italics using the i tag</i></p>

<!--Example below is the new way of making characters bold in Html by calling the strong tag on the target character -->
    <p><strong>This is the new way of making a letter bold using the strong tag</strong></p>
    
    <!--Example below is the new way of making characters Italics in Html by calling the em tag on the target character -->

    <h2>Lists in Html</h2>

    <p>There are to types of list in Html ordered list and unordered list below is the example of both</p>
    <p>There key difference between ordered list and unordered list is that ordered list is numbered while unordered list bulleted</p>

    <!--Ordered List example-->
    <ol>
        <li>First ordered list Item</li>
        <li>Second ordered list Item</li>
        <li>Third ordered list Item</li>
        <li>Fourth ordered list Item</li>
    </ol>

    <!--Unordered List example-->
    <ul>
        <li>first unordered list item</li>
        <li>second unordered list item</li>
        <li>third unordered list item</li>
        <li>fourth unordered list item</li>
    </ul>
<p>Another interesting topic in Html list is list nesting which simply put meaning having one list inside another list</p>

    <!--Nested List example-->
    <ol>
        <li>First list item</li>
        <li>second list Item
            <ul>
                <li>First Item in the nested unordered list</li>
                <li>Second Item in the nested unordered list
                    <ol>
                        <li>First item in the ordered list nested inside the nested unordered list</li>
                        <li>Second item in the ordered list nested inside the nested unordered list</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> I want to find out where you belong.
            <ol>
                <li>First item in the ordered list nested directly into the main ordered list</li>
                <li>Second item in the ordered list nested directly into the main ordered list</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
