    <p>There are two types of list in Html ordered list and unordered list below is the example of both</p>
    <p>There key difference between ordered list and unordered list is that ordered list is numbered while unordered list bulleted</p>
    
    <h3>Ordered list example in Html</h3>

        <li>fourth unordered list item</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nested List Example in Html</h3>
<p>Another interesting topic in Html list is list nesting which simply put means having one list inside another list</p>

    <!--Nested List example-->

                <li>Second Item in the nested unordered list
                    <ol>
                        <li>First item in the ordered list nested inside the nested unordered list</li>
                        <li>Second item in the ordered list nested inside the nested unordered list</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> I want to find out where you belong.
            <ol>
                <li>First item in the ordered list nested directly into the main ordered list</li>
